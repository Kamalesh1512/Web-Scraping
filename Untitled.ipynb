This is a great opportunity to enter the robust North Florida construction market.      -  Revenue for the General Contractor Business was $2.7M in 2022 but is forecasted to increase to $7.3M in 2023.   This increase is due to one large project which has already been lined up. This large project and a $1 million-dollar annual breakeven point puts any prospective buyer in great position to create significant profit potential.     In general, gross profit margins have been consistently around 25% over the last 4 years.     -  Revenue for the Architecture Business is usually around $400k or $500k with 25% to 30% margins.   -  The majority owner has been able to win business and get hired on projects more frequently than the average contractor.      Also, the majority owner is offering to provide initial training immediately after closing and can assist as a paid consultant after that. This training will include:    • How to close 90+ percent of all prospects on the first contact call.  • How to easily increase your profit on projects to 30% and still win the projects even when competitively bid.  • How to convert 90+ percent of projects to design build right off the first call.    The new owner or a designated project manager will be personally introduced to all existing clients.       Prospective buyers may find out more after a letter of intent has been drafted and a non-disclosure agreement has been executed.</p><!-- --><p class=\"show-on-mobile asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$1,500,000 </p><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div><div class=\"col-2 mobile-col-6 hide-on-mobile finance\"><p class=\"asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$1,500,000</p><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><button class=\"btn diamond-contact contactSeller ng-star-inserted\">Contact</button><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><span class=\"favorite saveFavorite favorite-normal ng-star-inserted\" title=\"Add to your saved listings\"></span><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div></a>,\n",

Simplified business model (Amazon FBA where Amazon stores, ships, sells, does customer service - the owner only needs to communicate with the supplier to send enough products to Amazon FBA directly so there is always stock Amazon can sell).    For 2022 alone the business has done over $700k in sales. As long as it has available inventory, products sell out and operations are automated and done by Amazon itself.    The business had a very consistent sales since the start (month by month financials since inception available after contact is made).    Importantly, this Amazon business sells only it's own dozen of unique brands and products - only my own products and designs - Not a reseller of other people's brands. This is important because only in this way you'll be in full control of everything: the look, the prices, the offer, the supplies.    I offer 1 full month of full support and training post sale - however, since the business is nearly on autopilot (taking current owner around 1-2 hours per week to manage) you will need around 2-3 zoom sessions at max to feel everything out and see around and get familiar with Amazon dashboard (nevertheless full 1 month is offered to ensure your comfort and success).    Everything is run by \"Fulfillment by Amazon\" model so stored, shipped and done by Amazon warehouses itself - that's why it's hands free.    Now, more than ever, people are looking for something to allow them to work from home. As we know, more brick and mortar stores are closing all the time, and more and more online businesses are booming (customers choose convenience of buying online) This is expected to keep increasing at an alarming rate through 2030 and beyond --and there's no end in sight to this increasing profitable business of selling on Amazon specifically, as it's the most reputable and popular platform (and growing) - so the right industry to enter and profit from.    One key perk: there is enough inventory already bough for the next couple of years of sales (over 100k in stock) that you will get as one of the assets with this business - in practice it means your recoupments and profits start right away from day 1 of ownership (because you would not need to invest anything in inventory or anything else for the next couple of years) - less headache and work for you, everything even more passive and streamlined.    There is no owner's financing offered or SBA so it's only available for cash buyers with liquid funds.    Feel free to reach out (please confirm that you're a cash buyer when doing so) and I will send you all detailed info on the business just next.</p><!-- --><p class=\"show-on-mobile asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$1,550,000 </p><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div><div class=\"col-2 mobile-col-6 hide-on-mobile finance\"><p class=\"asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$1,550,000</p><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><button class=\"btn diamond-contact contactSeller ng-star-inserted\">Contact</button><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><span class=\"favorite saveFavorite favorite-normal ng-star-inserted\" title=\"Add to your saved listings\"></span><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div></a>,\n",

That is a 36% profit margin which is very high compared to similar businesses.  They bought the business in 2020 and it took them most of 2021 to figure it out.  2022 is their first “normal” year and further proof of this is that January of 2023 was 13% higher than January of 2022 indicating that they are now able to focus on growth and not on how to run the business anymore.     The sales price is 840K which makes the sales price 2.2 times the adjusted earnings which is low for a very fast-growing company that has a 36% profit margin. The business grew 45% in revenues in 2022 compared to 2021 and over 100% in earnings. One of the reasons is that they are a 5-star rated company on all review sites and have 116 Google reviews which are very valuable for marketing and social media.      One of the owners has a separate marketing company and only works 3 hours a week on this business. The 2nd owner has worked 40 hours a week and wants to reduce that to 20 hours a week post-closing. The 3rd owner is the key employee who works full-time and wants to stay full-time post-closing.  The three owners will not only train the new owner but will stay post-closing for as long as the new owner wants them. They have several fantastic independent contractors to pick from who will be available for the new owner post-closing also.     The new owner doesn’t need any drapery, design, or construction experience but should be able to either manage the business and/or help with sales.  They work with various blinds/shades vendors, with established discounts on top of regular wholesale prices, and also create custom drapes and shades. There are no required licenses or certifications for the State of Colorado other than a sales tax license.    The buyer will get approximately 60K in current value assets made up of sewing machines, roller shade machines, a 2006 van, and various office equipment and furniture. The inventory varies but averages approximately 30K.      The business is growing very quickly already but there are ways to increase the growth and profits. Attending tradeshows, hiring another salesperson or doing some sales as the new owner, doing more commercial jobs, and increasing advertising, (they only spend about 1,000 dollars a month on marketing). The new owner can increase their social media presence by taking advantage of their 5-star review rating across all the important review sites and see tremendous growth by increasing the marketing budget.      The seller is asking for 840K plus inventory. They will be keeping their cash and accounts receivables and will pay off all debt including the accounts payables so that the business transfers debt free. The company is an S-Corp so this can be either a stock or an asset sale. This business should qualify for a standard SBA loan.    Details    Their work comes from 70% residential customers and only 30% commercial. The seller is very proud of the quality of products, the workmanship that they provide, and their customer service.    The owners will sign a non-compete. All 3 of the owners will help to transition the business. The business will not change after the closing.      They offer some of the best products in the industry and most have limited lifetime warranties by the manufacturer. The vendors will offer a line of credit which will increase over time as they get more comfortable with the new owner. Several of them offer a discount for ACH payments as well.    They only sell custom-made-to-measure products, so they don’t keep much inventory in stock. They are leasing 1,200 square feet with parking in Denver county. The space has 2 offices, a large warehouse/work area with all the machines, shelving for inventory, and a front showroom.    They have a great reputation for safety, quality, and reliability.</p><!-- --><p class=\"show-on-mobile asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$840,000 </p><!-- --><p class=\"cash-flow-on-mobile ng-star-inserted\">Cash Flow: $383,000</p><!-- --></div><!-- --></div><div class=\"col-2 mobile-col-6 hide-on-mobile finance\"><p class=\"asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$840,000</p><!-- --><!-- --><p class=\"cash-flow show-on-mobile ng-star-inserted\">Cash Flow: $383,000</p><!-- --><!-- --><button class=\"btn diamond-contact contactSeller ng-star-inserted\">Contact</button><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><span class=\"favorite saveFavorite favorite-center ng-star-inserted\" title=\"Add to your saved listings\"></span><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div></a>,\n",

Period. What was primarily a Landscape and Masonry Company for its first 30 years has turned into an elite design and build firm with repeat clientele at a very high level from North Orange County, through the Westside and Bel Air/BH, and out to Santa Barbara. 50-60 percent of the work is in L.A. Beverly Hills, Palos Verdes, Pasadena, Encino, Calabasas, Westlake Village, etc. There is a professional marketing company on a monthly retainer creating leads of all kinds from small patio type jobs to huge pool installs. No single client accounts for more than 3 percent of the company revenue. Probably THE largest asset of this firm is it’s exclusive relationship with the largest retailer of plants, pots, and home furnishings in the USA. 23 contractors in the entire USA are fortunate enough to be Partners with this retailer. The client comes into the store and talks about home furnishings, plants, design, etc. and the retail store sells them plants and soil for example. At the time of the sale they are given this company’s name as the exclusive installer for their area. The retailer gives the company the customer name and email and you call and introduce yourself as the vetted installer for said retailer. This contract in and of itself has to be valued at half $1 million as they generate 300,000 to 500,000 in revenue for the company each and every year. Some years the firm utilizes them less because their own book of business is just so large and constant. In slower times like the pandemic times this firm generated the same exact revenue as it always has which not many companies can say. The owner would rather have a partner than sell this business. If a buyer wants to buy the business and not be partners with the current owner that’s available as an option however the down payment is not negotiable. The remaining amount the owner is so confident in his business he will finance over 3 to 5 years at a little very low percentage 4 to 5%. Another huge plus is the marketing company can tailor the marketing each week according to the jobs in progress or where the new owner would like to work. For example if there is a big job in Encino and you want to target in Sino Tarzana Sherman Oaks during the time the cruise are at the Encino job the marketing company does that incredibly well. Now you have three jobs within 15 to 20 minutes of each other and that’s how money is made in this business. I repeat this business cannot be duplicated without many years of hard work meaning decades. There are trucks, tools, machinery, three different service yards to make getting to jobs easier and storing materials more convenient. Nothing hasn’t been thought of over the years and planned systematically. Do yourself a favor and at least check this business out. Again the owner is so confident he wants to stay as opposed to sell completely but will sell if that’s what a buyer wants. Must understand construction on some level. 3 different Contractors Licenses and one Government License held by the owner of this business. Lastly this company has a Gold Listing in The Blue Book Network the highest end Builders Network in the USA. Builder relationships are absolutely stellar and built on decades of trust and working with the highest level builders in the Southland another HUGE asset.</p><!-- --><p class=\"show-on-mobile asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$895,000 </p><!-- --><p class=\"cash-flow-on-mobile ng-star-inserted\">Cash Flow: $450,000</p><!-- --></div><div class=\"photo-count ng-star-inserted\"><i class=\"camera icon-white\"></i>6</div><!-- --></div><div class=\"col-2 mobile-col-6 hide-on-mobile finance\"><p class=\"asking-price ng-star-inserted\"><span><!-- --><!-- --></span>$895,000</p><!-- --><!-- --><p class=\"cash-flow show-on-mobile ng-star-inserted\">Cash Flow: $450,000</p><!-- --><!-- --><button class=\"btn diamond-contact contactSeller ng-star-inserted\">Contact</button><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><span class=\"favorite saveFavorite favorite-center ng-star-inserted\" title=\"Add to your saved listings\"></span><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div></a>,\n",
